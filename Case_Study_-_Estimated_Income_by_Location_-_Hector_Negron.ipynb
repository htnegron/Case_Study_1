    "<h2><b><u>Case Study: Estimated Income by Location</u></b></h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3><b><i>Background</i></b></h3>\n",
    "Each year the U.S. Census Bureau contacts 3.5 million U.S households for particpation in the American Community Survey (ACS) to collect data on demographics, housing, economic, and social attributes [1]. The ACS data currently comes in 1-year or 5-year estimates with differences in reliability, currency, and data availability affecting which version to use [2],[3]. The U.S. Census Bureau also maintains data that represents different geographic units in the United States called TIGER/Line files, which are available with ACS data included and can be used with Geographic Information Systems or Python library designed to work with geospatial data [4]. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3><b><i>Goal</i></b></h3>\n",
    "There are two main goals of this Case Study. The first is to gain practice incorporating different datasets together to gain a better insight into a topic through the use of <b><i>joins, merges, and concatenation </i></b>. This will help you apply what you have learned in DataCamp's <a href=\"https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/data-manipulation-with-pandas\">Data Manipulation with pandas</a> and <a href=\"https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/joining-data-with-pandas\">Joining Data with pandas</a>. The second goal is to explore using two particular types of data, <b><i>socioeconomic data and geospatial data</i></b>, and gain an idea of what these types of data can be used for. More specifically, you will look at <b><i>estimated income for households in Arkansas based on the county that the household is in</i></b>. \n",
    "\n",
    "<h3><b><i>Data</i></b></h3>\n",
    "This Case Study will use a subset of data from <a href = \"https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/tiger-data.html\"> the 2019 TIGER/Line with Selected Demographic and Economic Data </a> from the U.S. Census Bureau. There are two components to the dataset used in this Case Study. The first is a <b><i>Shapefile</i></b> containing the <b><i>TIGER/Line</i></b> County boundaries for the state of Arkansas. This <b><i>AR Counties Shapefile</i></b> was extracted from the original Tiger/Line County boundaries which contained Counties for the boundaries for the United States.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second dataset is the <b><i>5-year ACS estimate INCOME</i></b> data table exported as a csv file. This <b><i>INCOME</i></b> data contains <b><i>estimated household income for each County boundary in the United States based on the 2015-2019 time period</i></b>. An important designation to note is that a household contains all people who live in a single housing unit as their primary residence [5]. This means that each household could contain the income of a single resident or the combined incomes of multiple residents who all live in that household. We can't tell how many people reside in a household or contribute income to a household from the attributes in this csv file. All we can tell is a count of the households that fall under a certain attribute per county. This is an important distinction to make and something we must keep in mind when examining the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "<h3><b><i>Additional Requirements</i></b></h3>\n",
    "If you do not already have <b><i>geopandas</i></b> or <b><i>libpysal</i></b> Python libraries installed, you will need to install these using <b><i>pip</i></b>.  \n",
